The metadata for the data files in this folder are as follows:

## Vahsen_etal_Pb210.csv
* **depth_cm**	middle depth (in cm) of the 2 cm soil layer				
core_year	year that the core was extracted from Kirkpatrick Marsh				
core_month	month that the core was extracted from Kirkpatrick Marsh				
sample	core id (MX1, MX2, or MX4). MX stands for 'mixed' plots from a long-term elevated CO2 experiment (see Drake et al. (2014, doi:10.1111/gcb.12631) for details). Mixed plots contained a mix of two dominant marsh plant species Schoenoplectus americanus and Spartina patens at the start of the elevated CO2 experiment in 1987.				
bulk_dens_210pb	bulk density g cm-3				
acc_rate	calculated soil accretion rate using constant rate of supply model cm yr-1				
year	calculated soil year (AD)				
se	calculated soil year (AD) standard error
